OK * Substring 1: Length of the longest common substrings of two strings.
OK * Subsequences 1: Length of the longest common subsequence of two strings.
OK * Binary Search: Find if $n$ is in a sorted array of integers in log steps
OK * Permutations: Find all permutations of a given set.
-> don't forget to:

- for each element in the set
- remove the element
- find all permutations for the remaining set
- and add the element again.

- use lists to represent the sets in python, since sets are unordered
- be sure to use non-destructive methods such as filter to remove an element and use a + b instead of append

* Count Change: Count the number of ways to make change for 100 cent if you have [1, 5, 10, 25, 50] cent coins (SICP)
